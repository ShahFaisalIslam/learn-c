# The Beginning
To learn this grand language, one must begin humble.
Instead of expecting a program that exclaims "Hello, World!", which must be respected as a global approach to languages,
one must begin with the simplest of programs.

Remember, no tea is served without its container.
Similarly, in C, no code is executed without its container, the main() function.

The function is a group of code with a name for now.

This section presents two variations of the simplest main() function, and therefore, of the simplest C programs, and they are as follows:
1. void main(): This has no job other than executing whatever is inside it. As there is nothing, it truly does nothing. Think of it as an empty cup.
2. int main(): This is the same as above, with one exception: It outputs a number known as exit code, nd its value is the number written after return. Since we wrote 0, this program will output 0 exit code. For operating systems, exit code 0 means the program ran successfully. Of course it does not really mean much to us at the moment.

As for void main(), the word void means that there is nothing to be expected from the program once it is finished executing the main() function.

And as for int main(), the word int means that an integer is expected from the program by the operating system. This integer is a value provided by a return statement executed in the function.

Now you know the most important function in C language. _Userspace C, that is_.
