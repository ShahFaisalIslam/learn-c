Let's learn one of the most powerful ancient languages of the computer world!

# Why I began
In so many fantasy stories there has been a notion of ancient languages containing untold powers, sometimes world-shaking, and that those languages were notoriously difficult yet many times more potent.

I eventually came to look at C like that: An ancient language that can easily create the smallest and the most efficient and effective programs, and at the same time give a hell of a headache to both developer and the one unfortunate enough to hear their everyday ramblings.

So I thought, why not contribute to this ancient language by adding more of the carriers of misfortune i.e. its developers into the world?

If you share the same sentiment, then embark on the journey!
